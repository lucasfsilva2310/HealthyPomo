Healthy Pomo is a simple App based of Pomodoro technique, which consists in better management of your time.

You have the possibility to choose for how long you´ll be concentrated, you can customize your own profile, and it has a dark mode too!

It also tracks your completed challenges ( at the end of every timer, you´ll have a sort of relaxing challenge, if you complete it, you´ll gain some experience and could level up! Isn´t that awesome??).

## Getting Started

For this App I´m using the following Libraries/Frameworks

1.  [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
    : A simple library to help build custom react components just like a HTML tag

         `yarn add styled-components` || `npm install styled-components`

2.  [Js-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-cookie)
    : A basic Javascripts API for handling cookies in any way

         `yarn add js-cookie` || `npm install js-cookie`

3.[React](https://reactjs.org/)
: A Javascript library for building user interfaces.

        `npx create-react-app`

4.  [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper)
    : A way for handling states inside React in a simpler way.

         `import { createContext, useContext } from "react"`

## Acknowledmentes

This technique was helping a lot along the way for becoming a great developer, so I thought I customize one to make it better for me or anyone who is using this technique too!
